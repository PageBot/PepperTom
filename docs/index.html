								<h2>Scarves</h2>
							</header><p>The scarves are the result of many peoples’ work and creativity from rural Bangladesh to the cities of the Netherlands and the shores of the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Beautiful women of Bangladesh embroider the scarves by using the traditional Nakshi Kantha technique. The silk of the scarves is made of the best quality, Rajshahi Silk. The fabric is embossed in a workplace in Dhaka and embroidered in Dinajpur, a poor region in the northwest of Bangladesh. <br/>
<br/>
All under supervision of Kumudini Welfare Trust of Bengal. This NGO is part of the World Fair Trade Forum and Ecota Fair Trade Forum. In 2008 they received the Award of Excellence for Handicrafts South Asia from Unesco. <br/>
<br/>
Under the name of Generous Gesture, the scarves have won a Bronze Award for the European Design Award 2010 in the category ‘Self Initiated Projects’ <br/>
<br/>
Generous Gesture has been nominated for the German Design Award 2012. <br/>
<br/>
Generous Gesture is a people project. Every piece we make is 100% fair trade. The principle op Generous Gesture is creating fair trade with sustainable products. Through an exchange of ideas and skills we create a win-win situation for all concerned parties.

								<h2>Pants</h2>
							</header><p>The fabric of these pants has been produced by the best craftsmen of Kumudini Welfare Trust of Bengal. Beautiful women who live in Dinajpur, a poor region in the northwest of Bangladesh, have mastered the traditional embroidery technique Nakshi Kantha. This is a running stitch technique entirely embroidered by hand. The fabrics of the pants are or cotton double layered, or a combination of cotton and silk. The fabrics are natural dyed. Small inconsistencies are characteristics of the handcrafted process. The pants are feminine and cool. You can wear them chic, classic and casual, They will mix and match with your wardrobe for almost every occasion. We hope you will wear them with joy and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
All pants have wide legs. The pants with or without a waistband. All very comfortable to wear. Iconic, centerpiece items:Timeless!<br/>
<br/>
The pants are produced in a Dutch atelier, piece by piece.
