## Desirable products

Where do clothing and fabrics come from? Who made them and under what circumstances? Often there is no answer to these questions, even when asking them in expensive stores.

Wouldn’t it be nice to wear clothes where it is clear who made them? Where the conditions of fabrication are good and the trade is fair?  

Pepper+Tom wants that, sharing experience, collaborating with partners in the clothing chain, who think and act the same way. To make the production, resources and materials traceable for every garment. Pepper+Tom supports the idea of ‘true cost’ and ‘slow fashion’, adding to the pleasure of wearing the clothes.

# Skirts

Pepper+Tom skirts are perfect basic items that should not be missing in your wardrobe. They are designed in various sizes, fabrics (cotton, silk and wool) different lengths and delicately finished with a colored zipper. The skirts are made from sustainable fabrics. Semi couture by a Dutch Atelier. 

Confident women accentuate their individuality with their outfit. Cowboy boots under a fashionable skirt. High heals under a loose dress or pants. They combine stylish and tough. They choose for comfort above catwalk, appreciating beautiful and well-made garments. They opt for Pepper+Tom.

Quote’s by Pepper+Tom customers:
‘It’s a simple style, good model, clear!’
‘I can wear it all day, all night, everywhere’
‘Very flattering to many figure types’

Pepper+Tom would like to say to all women:
‘Just keep dancing!’

# Scarves

The scarves are the result of many peoples’ work and creativity from rural Bangladesh to the cities of the Netherlands and the shores of the United States.

Beautiful women of Bangladesh embroider the scarves by using the traditional Nakshi Kantha technique. The silk of the scarves is made of the best quality, Rajshahi Silk. The fabric is embossed in a workplace in Dhaka and embroidered in Dinajpur, a poor region in the northwest of Bangladesh.

All under supervision of Kumudini Welfare Trust of Bengal. This NGO is part of the World Fair Trade Forum and Ecota Fair Trade Forum. In 2008 they received the Award of Excellence for Handicrafts South Asia from Unesco.

Under the name of Generous Gesture, the scarves have won a Bronze Award for the European Design Award 2010 in the category ‘Self Initiated Projects’

Generous Gesture has been nominated for the German Design Award 2012.

Claudia Mens

I am the child of the woods.
We lived in a wooden house. At a dirt road.
Endlessly tinker with acorns.
Myself hiding under the ferns.
Preferably in a sweater and pants.
Wow, what a freedom, what a space.
Always together with other kids.

“Watching is a verb,” my mother would say “look at the world. Look how beautiful that portrait has been painted.”
I drew notebooks. Making atmospheres and environments, little peepshows. Then crept behind my mom’s Husqvarna sewing machine and sewed a wide comfy skirt. To climb into trees.

After three decades, running a studio from 1980 till 2010, it was time for something else. Claudia went looking and longing for the woods of her childhood. She found that feeling back on Martha's Vineyard in the USA, where she began drawing with childlike pleasure and painting. Arose leafs and fern motifs, inspired by her travels in Africa, South America and Asia.

She designed a series of scarves with type and motifs of leafs, produced by NGO Kumudini Welfare Trust in Bangladesh. In 2016, she started with a lot of spirit and fun Pepper+Tom.

Besides the products of Pepper+Tom, similar to work in all of the photo's on this website, design can be made by Claudia as a special custom assignment. Ask her: claudia@petr.com
